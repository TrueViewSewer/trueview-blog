Utah's real estate market in 2025 is intense. With homes selling fast and often above asking price, buyers are feeling the pressure to act quickly—and sometimes to skip inspections altogether. But there's one inspection that savvy buyers across Utah County, Salt Lake County, and beyond are prioritizing: the sewer scope.

A sewer inspection could be the difference between peace of mind and a $15,000 surprise. Here's why it matters now more than ever.

## Utah Real Estate Market Trends in 2025

Whether you're house hunting in Salt Lake City, Provo, Lehi, or Eagle Mountain, here's what you're up against:

<div class="stats-grid">
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="stat-number">$580,000</div>
<div class="stat-label">Average Utah home price (up 12%)</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="stat-number">28 days</div>
<div class="stat-label">Average days on market</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="stat-number">73%</div>
<div class="stat-label">Homes receive multiple offers</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="stat-number">45%</div>
<div class="stat-label">Buyers waiving inspections</div>
</div>
</div>

Many homes go under contract within days. Sellers are choosing strong offers with minimal contingencies. And that leaves little room for buyers to uncover hidden issues—unless they act fast and inspect smart.

## Why Sewer Inspections Are Essential

### Aging Pipes in Older Neighborhoods

<div class="callout-warning">
<strong>⚠️ High Risk Areas:</strong> From Sugar House and Millcreek to central Provo and Pleasant Grove, many homes were built in the 1960s–80s. Sewer lines from that era are nearing the end of their lifespan.
</div>

Tree roots, corrosion, and shifting soil lead to cracks, bellies, and partial collapses—none of which are visible during a regular home inspection.

### New Construction Risks

Even in brand-new communities like Saratoga Springs or Daybreak, rushed builds and poor grading can cause issues. We've scoped newly built homes with:

<div class="cost-box">
<h4>Common New Construction Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Crushed lines from improper backfill</li>
<li>Misaligned fittings</li>
<li>Standing water or "bellies" from poor slope</li>
<li><strong>Repair costs: $2,000–$8,000</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

Sewer problems aren't just for old houses.

### Utah Soil + Climate = Pipe Stress

Utah's clay-rich soil expands and contracts with moisture. Winter freeze-thaw cycles also impact underground lines, especially in areas like Highland, Herriman, and Draper with slope and elevation changes.

## The Hidden Cost of Skipping a $149 Inspection

<div class="callout-danger">
<strong>💸 Reality Check:</strong> Here's what buyers risk by skipping a $150–$300 inspection:
</div>

<div class="cost-box">
<h4>Emergency Sewer Repair Costs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Replacement:</strong> $8,000–$15,000</li>
<li><strong>Partial Repairs:</strong> $3,000–$8,000</li>
<li><strong>Sewage Backup Cleanup:</strong> $500–$2,000+</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="cost-box">
<h4>Hidden Expenses</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporary Housing:</strong> $150–$300 per night</li>
<li><strong>Property Damage Repairs:</strong> $2,000–$10,000+</li>
<li><strong>Lost Use of the Home:</strong> 3–7 days</li>
</ul>
</div>

## How Sewer Inspections Help Buyers Win

Even in competitive markets, a sewer scope gives you:

### Negotiation Leverage

<div class="callout-success">
<strong>💪 Real Power:</strong> If issues are found, you can request price reductions, ask for repairs, or use the report to strengthen your negotiating position.
</div>

Some buyers have used sewer findings to negotiate $10,000+ off the purchase price.

### Confidence to Move Forward

If the line is clear, you gain peace of mind. It's one less thing to worry about in a major transaction.

### Clarity on Future Costs

Even minor findings help you plan ahead. Knowing about root intrusion or early corrosion allows you to budget for maintenance.

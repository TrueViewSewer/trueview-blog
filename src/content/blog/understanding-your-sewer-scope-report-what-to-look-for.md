## What's Included in Your Sewer Scope Report

A professional sewer scope inspection report should include several key components:

### High-Definition Video Documentation

Your report will include video footage of the entire accessible sewer line, showing the camera's journey from entry point to municipal connection. This visual evidence helps you and your agent clearly understand the condition and location of any issues.

### Written Summary and Analysis

In addition to the video, you'll receive a written analysis explaining what was found, how severe it is, and what next steps are recommended. This part of the report translates technical terms into actionable insights.

### Photographic Evidence

Still images taken from the video highlight key findings. These are useful for reviewing issues later or discussing solutions with contractors or sellers.

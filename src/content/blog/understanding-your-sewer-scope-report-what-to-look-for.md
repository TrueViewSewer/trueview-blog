## What's Included in Your Sewer Scope Report

A professional sewer scope inspection report should include several key components:

### High-Definition Video Documentation

Your report will include video footage of the entire accessible sewer line, showing the camera’s journey from entry point to municipal connection. This visual evidence helps you and your agent clearly understand the condition and location of any issues.

### Written Summary and Analysis

In addition to the video, you’ll receive a written analysis explaining what was found, how severe it is, and what next steps are recommended. This part of the report translates technical terms into actionable insights.

### Photographic Evidence

Still images taken from the video highlight key findings. These are useful for reviewing issues later or discussing solutions with contractors or sellers.

## Reading Your Video Report

The video portion of your inspection gives you a full tour of your sewer line:

### Entry and Exit Points

- Footage typically starts at a cleanout or toilet flange  
- Ends at the city tie-in or septic tank connection  
- These points confirm the scope and boundaries of the inspection

### Conditions Along the Pipe

Watch for:
- Pipe material transitions (e.g. cast iron to PVC)  
- Build-up, debris, or standing water  
- Roots or structural damage  
- Measurement markers to locate issues precisely

## Questions to Ask Your Inspector

**Repair Costs and Options**  
- What repairs are urgent?  
- Can some issues be monitored instead of fixed now?  
- Are multiple solutions available?

**Timeline and Impact**  
- How soon should repairs be done?  
- Will they affect home habitability?

**System-Wide vs. Localized Problems**  
- Are problems isolated or affecting the entire line?

**Maintenance Advice**  
- How often should you reinspect?  
- Are there preventive tools or treatments?

**Warranties and Guarantees**  
- Will your inspector verify post-repair fixes?  
- Are there guarantees on the report accuracy?

## Negotiating With Your Sewer Scope Report

A professional sewer inspection empowers homebuyers in negotiations:

### Use the Report to…

- Require specific issues to be resolved before closing  
- Walk away from deals with major problems backed by video proof

## What to Do Next

- Save report for future reference  
- Schedule maintenance every 2–3 years

### Minor Issues
- Get estimates

### Major Issues
- Get multiple repair bids  
- Consult with your agent  
- Consider walking if the repair cost is too high

## Utah-Specific Sewer Line Considerations

Homeowners across Utah—from Lehi to Draper to Sugar House—face unique challenges depending on the age of the property and local conditions:

- **Older homes (pre-1980)**: Risk of failing clay or cast-iron pipes  
- **Utah County & Salt Lake**: Clay-heavy soil can cause settling  
- **Park City & Heber**: Freeze-thaw cycles impact pipe alignment  
- **Established neighborhoods**: Mature trees increase root risk  
- **Hilly properties**: Sewer grading and flow issues more common

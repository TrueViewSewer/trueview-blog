Utah‚Äôs real estate market in 2025 is intense. With homes selling fast and often above asking price, buyers are feeling the pressure to act quickly‚Äîand sometimes to skip inspections altogether. But there‚Äôs one inspection that savvy buyers across Utah County, Salt Lake County, and beyond are prioritizing: the sewer scope.

A sewer inspection could be the difference between peace of mind and a $15,000 surprise. Here‚Äôs why it matters now more than ever.

## Utah Real Estate Market Trends in 2025

Whether you're house hunting in Salt Lake City, Provo, Lehi, or Eagle Mountain, here‚Äôs what you're up against:

- **Average Utah home price**: $580,000 (up 12% from 2024)
- **Days on market**: 28
- **Multiple offer rate**: 73%
- **Cash purchases**: 31% of homes
- **Buyers waiving inspections**: 45%

Many homes go under contract within days. Sellers are choosing strong offers with minimal contingencies. And that leaves little room for buyers to uncover hidden issues‚Äîunless they act fast and inspect smart.

## Why Sewer Inspections Are Essential

### Aging Pipes in Older Neighborhoods

From Sugar House and Millcreek to central Provo and Pleasant Grove, many homes were built in the 1960s‚Äì80s. Sewer lines from that era are nearing the end of their lifespan, especially cast iron and clay pipes.

Tree roots, corrosion, and shifting soil lead to cracks, bellies, and partial collapses‚Äînone of which are visible during a regular home inspection.

### New Construction Risks

Even in brand-new communities like Saratoga Springs or Daybreak, rushed builds and poor grading can cause issues. We‚Äôve scoped newly built homes with:

- Crushed lines from improper backfill
- Misaligned fittings
- Standing water or ‚Äúbellies‚Äù from poor slope

Sewer problems aren‚Äôt just for old houses.

### Utah Soil + Climate = Pipe Stress

Utah‚Äôs clay-rich soil expands and contracts with moisture. Winter freeze-thaw cycles also impact underground lines, especially in areas like Highland, Herriman, and Draper with slope and elevation changes.

## The Hidden Cost of Skipping a Sewer Scope

Here‚Äôs what buyers risk by skipping a $150‚Äì$300 inspection:

- **Complete sewer line replacement**: $8,000‚Äì$15,000
- **Partial repair (dig & replace)**: $3,000‚Äì$8,000
- **Emergency backup cleanup**: $500‚Äì$2,000 per incident

These repairs often aren‚Äôt covered by insurance‚Äîand they‚Äôre your responsibility once you own the home.

## How Sewer Inspections Help Buyers Win

Even in competitive markets, a sewer scope gives you:

### Negotiation Leverage

If issues are found, you can:

- Request price reductions or credits
- Ask for repairs before closing
- Use the report as a tool to strengthen your case

Some buyers have used sewer findings to negotiate $10,000+ off the purchase price.

### Confidence to Move Forward

If the line is clear, you gain peace of mind. It‚Äôs one less thing to worry about in a major transaction.

### Clarity on Future Costs

Even minor findings help you plan ahead. Knowing about root intrusion or early corrosion allows you to budget for maintenance.

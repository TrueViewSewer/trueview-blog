When you're buying a home in Utah, there's one inspection that could save you from a nightmare scenario that thousands of homebuyers face every year. Picture this: you've just closed on your dream home in Draper, and three weeks later, you discover your sewer line has collapsed—requiring a $15,000 emergency repair that could have been prevented with a $149 inspection.

Utah’s real estate market is hotter than ever, with homes moving fast in places like Lehi, Sandy, Pleasant Grove, and Salt Lake City. In the rush to make competitive offers, buyers are often waiving inspections—especially sewer scopes. But what most realtors won’t mention? Standard home inspections do not include the sewer line. That means you're on the hook for any hidden issues underground.

## Utah’s Hidden Sewer Crisis

### Why Sewer Problems Are So Common Here

**Aging Infrastructure + New Builds**  
From older homes in Orem to rapid new construction in Saratoga Springs, Utah’s sewer lines are under pressure. Original clay or cast iron pipes in pre-1980 homes are reaching the end of their lifespan, while some newer builds suffer from rushed installation.

**Soil Movement**  
Expansive clay soils in areas like Eagle Mountain and Herriman cause ground shifting—misaligning pipes or creating cracks that lead to major problems over time.

**Tree Roots**  
Even beautiful landscaping in Sugar House or American Fork comes with a risk: tree roots aggressively infiltrate small pipe cracks, leading to blockages and costly backups.

**Poor Grading or Installation**  
Especially in fast-growing suburbs, we've seen sewer lines installed with improper slopes, weak joints, or insufficient support—all of which create headaches down the road.

## What We Typically Find

**Root Intrusion**  
Frequent in mature neighborhoods—roots grow into joints, leading to blockages.  
Repair Cost: $500–$3,000

**Pipe Misalignment**  
Caused by shifting soil or settling, common in Lehi and Bluffdale.  
Repair Cost: $1,500–$6,000

**Outdated Materials**  
Clay or cast iron lines degrade over time, especially in homes built before 1980.  
Replacement Cost: $8,000–$15,000

**Improper Slope or Connections**  
New construction areas often have sewer lines installed too flat or with poor couplings.  
Repair Cost: $2,000–$8,000

## Why Skipping a $149 Inspection Is So Risky

**Emergency Sewer Repair Costs**  
- Full Replacement: $8,000–$15,000  
- Partial Repairs: $3,000–$8,000  
- Sewage Backup Cleanup: $500–$2,000+

**Hidden Expenses**  
- Temporary Housing: $150–$300 per night  
- Property Damage Repairs: $2,000–$10,000+  
- Lost Use of the Home: 3–7 days

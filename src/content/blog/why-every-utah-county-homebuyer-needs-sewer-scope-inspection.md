When you're buying a home in Utah, there's one inspection that could save you from a nightmare scenario that thousands of homebuyers face every year. Picture this: you've just closed on your dream home in Draper, and three weeks later, you discover your sewer line has collapsed‚Äîrequiring a $15,000 emergency repair that could have been prevented with a $149 inspection.

Utah's real estate market is hotter than ever, with homes moving fast in places like Lehi, Sandy, Pleasant Grove, and Salt Lake City. In the rush to make competitive offers, buyers are often waiving inspections‚Äîespecially sewer scopes. But what most realtors won't mention? **Standard home inspections do not include the sewer line.** That means you're on the hook for any hidden issues underground.

## Utah's Hidden Sewer Crisis

### Why Sewer Problems Are So Common Here

</div>

**Aging Infrastructure + New Builds**  
From older homes in Orem to rapid new construction in Saratoga Springs, Utah's sewer lines are under pressure. Original clay or cast iron pipes in pre-1980 homes are reaching the end of their lifespan, while some newer builds suffer from rushed installation.

**Soil Movement**  
Expansive clay soils in areas like Eagle Mountain and Herriman cause ground shifting‚Äîmisaligning pipes or creating cracks that lead to major problems over time.

**Tree Roots**  
Even beautiful landscaping in Sugar House or American Fork comes with a risk: tree roots aggressively infiltrate small pipe cracks, leading to blockages and costly backups.

**Poor Grading or Installation**  
Especially in fast-growing suburbs, we've seen sewer lines installed with improper slopes, weak joints, or insufficient support‚Äîall of which create headaches down the road.

## Buyer Tips for Competitive Markets

<div class="callout">
<strong>üí° Smart Strategies:</strong> Even in multiple-offer situations, you can still protect yourself:
</div>

- **Include sewer scope only** in your offer contingency

- **Offer to pay regardless of outcome**

These tactics show sellers you're serious‚Äîwithout skipping critical due diligence.

## How Sewer Inspections Help You Win

### Negotiation Leverage

If issues are found, you can:

- Request price reductions or credits
- Ask for repairs before closing
- Use the report as a tool to strengthen your case
